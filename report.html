<h1>CP1406/1806/5638 - 2017 Group Project Report</h1>
<h2>Group Number 13</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Liam Williams, Francine Nihozeko, Christopher Croucher
<h2>Project Links</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/var/www/sites/12/jc451291/public_html/M2">Site Home Page</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LiamWilliams1/M1" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://itatjcu.slack.com/messages/G56N3BDEK" target="_blank">Slack group 13</a> 
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Liam Williams: </strong> Donation form, Newsfeed, Navigation bar, Photo Gallery, edited header, compiled all pages for submission</li>
    <li><strong>Francine Nihozeko: </strong> Home Page + General meeting page, Contact page, Concerts page+ detailed 2017 concerts pages, Photo Gallery, edited navigation and footer, compiled all pages for submission </li>
    <li><strong>Christopher Croucher:</strong> History Page, Artist Directory, Detailed Artist Pages, designed Header Image</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>We proofred all pages and tested to see if all buttons worked . We fixed images not loading and incorrect file paths.</p>
<p> The button to buy concert ticket is linked to a broken site, because we could not find the actual ticket form </p>
<p> Additionally, the facebook pluggin is inconsistent amongst browsers- sometimes it loads, other times it doesn't </p>
<p> Lastly, in the concerts page, only the 2017 concerts are linked to the concert ticket pages. This is because other concerts have already passed and there was no need to have the buy ticket button on them</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>

<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Good communication between teammates</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> In  the last couple of days despite some major set backs, our team pulled together and completed our site</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Github (Constantly failing to commit or edit work)</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Our development team was under a lot of stress as it went through some changes.</p>
<p> We lost a man due to illness and due to poor communication on his behalf we didn't know we lost him until much later.<p>
<p> For a large portion of our development cycle we had only 2 men working on the website.<p>
<p> Once we gained a 3rd member again out of shear luck we had to catch her up to speed<p>
<p> The task sheet came to everyone late.<p>
<p> We experienced a major mishap with one of our team members agreeing to complete a portion of the website and not completing it.<p>
<p> This portion of the website was then completed by the remaining members of the team at the last minute.<p>

<p><strong>Interesting: </strong>Github is a proffesional file sharing/version control suite  and take a proffessional mindset to use. Github was the main source of the hurdles involved in completeing this website.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> For the future group projects, it would be efficient to have a designated leader in the team </p>
