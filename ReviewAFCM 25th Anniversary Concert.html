<p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied music lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anniversary with it’s first ever outdoor public performance.</p>

<p>The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the performance by Camerata of St Johns with their virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance with her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.</p>

<p>1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville audiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely was heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel.</p>

<p>The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant afternoon can only be rated as a huge success and may prove to be the first of many performances in years to come.</p>
